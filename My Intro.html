                 <h2>Hi, I'm an 18-year-old passionate coder currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) with a specialization in Data Science and Analytics. My academic journey has been diverse, starting with a focus on Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in high school. However, my interest in technology has always been strong, and I am now fully immersed in the tech field, where I truly belong.
                 <br><br>
                    I've completed my first year with a CGPA of 9.11 . My technical expertise includes programming languages such as C, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I've gained knowledge in operating systems, SQL, DBMS, NumPy, pandas and in Power BI for data visualisation. I am continually developing my skills and expanding my understanding of the field. </h2>
